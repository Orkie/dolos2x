# dolos2x
GP2X Emulator

* Built on Unicorn
* Can currently run the Open2x bootloader, and some homebrew written with Orcus

## TODO

* Be able to boot Linux
* Support multiple RGB layers and 2d accelerator
* GDB debug stub
* Try to make use of qemu vvfat and SD code to do a better job of SD emulation

## See it running!
